Step-1: State the hypotheses. The population mean is 100.

H0: µ= 100
H1: µ > 100

Step-2: Set up the significance level. It is not given in the problem so let’s assume it as 5% (0.05).

Step-3: Compute the random chance probability using z score and z-table.

z=(x-µ)/SD 
SD= Standard Deviation

For this set of data: z= (108-100) / (15/sqrt(36))=3.20

You can look at the probability by looking at z- table and p-value associated with 3.20 is 0.9993
i.e. probability of having value less than 108 is 0.9993 and more than or equals to 108 is (1-0.9993)=0.0007.

Step-4: It is less than 0.05 so we will reject the Null hypothesis i.e. there is raw cornstarch effect.
